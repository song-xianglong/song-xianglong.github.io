Hello, I am Xianglong Song (宋相龙), an undergraduate of [School of Physics](https://physics.nankai.edu.cn/wlxyen/main.htm) at [Nankai University](https://en.nankai.edu.cn). I am deeply fascinated by the marvelous
properties exhibited by elementary particles.

I am especially interested in

- Phenomenology of Quantum Chromodynamics;
- Particle physics experiments at high energy colliders;
- Tabletop experiments for BSM physics;
- Detection of cosmic rays.

Since my freshman year, I have always been studying QCD phenomenology in Prof. [Lei Chang (常雷)](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1029609)'s research group. I was a visiting student at [CMS group](https://www.roma1.infn.it/en/ricerca/csn1/cms.html) at Sapienza Università di Roma in my sophomore year, where I worked with Prof. [Letícia Cunqueiro](https://corsidilaurea.uniroma1.it/en/users/leticiacunqueiromendezuniroma1it). I worked on a small project about cosmic rays with Prof. [Gwenael Giacinti](https://tdli.sjtu.edu.cn/EN/people/t-d-lee-fellows/128/GwenaelGiacinti) at Tsung-Dao Lee Institute in my junior year. And I am collaborating on analysis on Higgs physics with Prof. [Caterina Vernieri](https://profiles.stanford.edu/caterina-vernieri) at SLAC during the second half of 2024. I will also work with Prof. [Tao Han](https://www.physicsandastronomy.pitt.edu/people/tao-han) from September, 2024.

I'm really into FPS games!
