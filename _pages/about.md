Hello, I am Xianglong Song (宋相龙), a master student in [Physics](https://www.physik.lmu.de/en/) at [LMU Munich](https://www.lmu.de/de/index.html). Before that, I was an undergraduate of [School of Physics](https://physics.nankai.edu.cn/wlxyen/main.htm) at [Nankai University](https://en.nankai.edu.cn). I am deeply fascinated by the marvelous
properties exhibited by elementary particles.

I am especially interested in

- Particle physics experiments at high energy colliders;
- Collider phenomenology;
- Precision measurement for BSM physics;
- Detection of cosmic rays.

I studied QCD phenomenology in Prof. [Lei Chang](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1029609)'s research group in my freshman year and sophomore year. I was a visiting student at [CMS group](https://www.roma1.infn.it/en/ricerca/csn1/cms.html) at Sapienza Università di Roma in my sophomore year, where I worked with Prof. [Letícia Cunqueiro](https://corsidilaurea.uniroma1.it/en/users/leticiacunqueiromendezuniroma1it). I worked on a project about cosmic rays with Prof. [Gwenael Giacinti](https://tdli.sjtu.edu.cn/EN/people/t-d-lee-fellows/128/GwenaelGiacinti) at Tsung-Dao Lee Institute in my junior year. And I collaborated on analysis on Higgs physics with Prof. [Caterina Vernieri](https://profiles.stanford.edu/caterina-vernieri) at Stanford University for a year during 2024-2025. I did my thesis on beyond Standard Model phenomenology at future colliders with Prof. [Lorenzo Calibbi](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1034527) at Nankai in 2025. Now I graduated and became a master student at LMU Munich. This is a beartiful city!

I'm really into FPS games!
