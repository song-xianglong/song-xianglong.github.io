## Thesis: Searches for BSM physics at future colliders.
Dec. 2024 - May. 2025, **Nankai University**  
Tianjin, China  
Supervised by Prof. Lorenzo Calibbi  
- Wrote a UFO model file for Axion-Like Particle (ALP) interaction with the Standard Model and developed the theory part of the production and decay of ALP.
- Generated signal and background events for CEPC simulation, studied the $e^+e^-\to Z\to a\gamma,\, a\to b\bar{b}$ decay mode with MadGraph and related software, which not only fully exploited the CEPC’s outstanding b-tagging performance but also represented the first dedicated study of this decay channel.
- Set appropriate cuts on the observables to efficiently separate the signal and background events, and derived limitations on ALP parameter space which can be studied on CEPC.

## $t\bar{t}H+tH$ $\mathcal{CP}$ analysis on ATLAS.
Jul. 2024 - Jun. 2025, **SLAC, Stanford University**  
California, USA  
Supervised by Prof. **Caterina Vernieri** and Dr. **Brendon Bullard**
- Reconstructed top quark events with the identification of jet triplets by χ2 implementation, which served as a baseline.
- Trained a deep neural network to distinguish reconstruction-level jets which are processed by truth matching with truth-level jets, and compared with the BDT(boosted decision trees) approach.
- Training a neural network to separate $t\bar{t}H+tH$ signal from background processes and to separate events produced by $\mathcal{CP}$-even and $\mathcal{CP}$-odd process simultaneously.
- Code avaliable on [GitHub](https://github.com/song-xianglong/ttHCP).
  
## From multi-wavelength data to electron distribution.
Jan. 2024, **Tsung-Dao Lee Institute, Shanghai Jiao Tong University**  
Shanghai, China  
Supervised by Prof. **Gwenael Giacinti**
- Used Naima package to calculate LHAASO data and generated the photon spectrum from the Crab Nebula and analyzed the origin of these photons.
- Fitted the photon spectrum with processes like synchrotron radiation, inverse Compton scattering and Pion decay.
- Used exponential cutoff double broken power law to replace the unknown acceleration mechanism.
- [Presentation slides](../assets/CrabPre.pdf).
- Code avaliable on [GitHub](https://github.com/song-xianglong/CrabElectron).

## SoftDrop isolation on exploring QED splitting function.
Jul. 2023 - Oct. 2023, **Sapienza Università di Roma**  
Rome, Italy  
Supervised by Prof. **Letícia Cunqueiro**
- Distinguished photons from mesons’decay and quarks with the combination of SoftDrop declustering and isolation techniques.
- Isolated photons from quark-photon emissions, removed soft radiation and background effects.
- Showed a strong correlation between the momentum sharing in photon isolation and the theoretical expectations from QED.
- Here is a [manuscript](../assets/A%20Fundemental%20Study%20on%20Photon%20Isolation.pdf).
- Code avaliable on [GitHub](https://github.com/song-xianglong/SoftDrop).

## Extrapolate lattice pion DA and test its effect on the $\pi-\gamma$ transition form factor.
Apr. 2023 - Jan. 2024, **Nankai University**  
Tianjin, China  
Supervised by Prof. **Lei Chang**
- Constructed self-consistent models for the dressed quark propagator, the Bethe-Salpeter amplitude of the pion, and the electromagnetic quark-photon interaction vertex.
- Modeled the pion distribution amplitude and its QCD evolution with lattice data and ERBL evolution equations.
- Reproduced the chiral anomaly in the transition form factor, particularly at $Q^2 = 0$.
- Addressed discrepancies in experimental data, particularly at high photon momentum transfer.

## Contour deformation for computing light-front quantities.
Sep. 2022 - Nov. 2022, **Nankai University**  
Tianjin, China  
Supervised by Prof. **Lei Chang**
- Based on contour deformations combined with analytic continuation methods to project the Bethe-Salpeter wave function onto the light front.
- Applied the new contour deformation method on the generalization to unequal masses in the BSE and implementation of complex conjugate propagator singularities.
