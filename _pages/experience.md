# Previous Research Experience

## Solving the gap equation of the NJL model through iterations: unexpected chaos.
May. 2022 - Jul. 2022, **Nankai University**  
Tianjin, China  
supervised by Prof. Lei Chang
- We explored the behavior of the iterative procedure to obtain the solution to the gap equation of the NLJ model for arbitrarily large values of the coupling constant.
- Solved the equation numerically with Mathematica to verify the emergence of chaos.

## Research about contour deformation for computing light-front quantities.
Sep. 2022 - Nov. 2022, **Nankai University**  
Tianjin, China  
supervised by Prof. Lei Chang
- It was based on contour deformations combined with analytic continuation methods to project the Bethe-Salpeter wave function onto the light front.
- Applied the new contour deformation method on the generalization to unequal masses in the BSE and implementation of complex conjugate propagator singularities.

## Extrapolate lattice pion DA and test its effect on the $\pi-\gamma$ transition form factor.
Apr. 2023 - Apr. 2024, **Nankai University**  
Tianjin, China  
supervised by Prof. Lei Chang
- We constructed a type of effective model that inversely deduces the $\pi$ meson’s Bethe-Salpeter amplitude (BSA) from its distribution amplitude, and subsequently calculated the $\pi-\gamma$ transition form factor.
- Solved the parton distribution amplitude (PDA) inversely with Mathematica (FeynCalc).
- Publication: [Pion to two photons transition form factor.](../assets/Pion_to_two_photons_transition_form_factor.pdf) (awaiting submission)

## SoftDrop isolation on exploring QED splitting function.
Jul. 2023 - Dec. 2023, **Sapienza Università di Roma**  
Rome, Italy  
supervised by Prof. Letícia Cunqueiro
- Used SoftDrop isolation to explore the QED splitting function in $q → q\gamma$ process.
- Generated splittings with Pythia, wrote macros in C++ using FastJet and plotted with Root.
- SoftDrop isolation did well in distinguishing photons from mesons’ decay and quarks.
- Here is a [manuscript](../assets/A%20Fundemental%20Study%20on%20Photon%20Isolation.pdf).

## From multi-wavelength data to electron distribution.
Jan. 2024, **Tsung-Dao Lee Institute, Shanghai Jiao Tong University**  
Shanghai, China  
supervised by Prof. Gwenael Giacinti
- The Crab Nebula is generally the brightest persistent $\gamma$-ray source in the sky, up to 100 TeV, even at a PeV energy scale.
- We used Naima package to calculate LHAASO data and generated the photon spectrum we got from the Crab Nebula and analyzed the origin of these photons.

# Ongoing and Upcoming Research

## Calculation of Various Form Factors with a Novel Approach.
**Nankai University**  
Tianjin, China  
supervised by Prof. Lei Chang
- Inspired by the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.06635), we are trying to calculate the various form factors of pion under the ladder approximation of the Bethe-Salpeter equation, with contact interactions. The work
is supervised by Prof. Chang.

## ttH+tH CP analysis on ATLAS.
**SLAC**  
California, USA  
would be supervised by Prof. Caterina Vernieri
- We will train a neural network to separate ttH+tH signal from background processes and to separate events produced by CP-even and CP-odd process simultaneously.
